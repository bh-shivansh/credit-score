**Credit Scoring**

### What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a three-digit number that evaluates your creditworthiness. It is calculated based on your credit history and is used by lenders to assess the risk of lending you money.

### Factors Affecting Credit Score

1. **Payment History (35%)**
   - **Significance**: This is the most significant factor. It tracks whether you have paid past credit accounts on time.
   - **Impact**: Late payments, defaults, and bankruptcies can severely impact your score.

2. **Credit Utilization (30%)**
   - **Significance**: Represents the ratio of your current credit balances to your credit limits.
   - **Impact**: It's best to keep your credit utilization below 30% to maintain a good score.

3. **Length of Credit History (15%)**
   - **Significance**: The longer your credit history, the better.
   - **Impact**: It considers the age of your oldest account, newest account, and the average age of all your accounts.

4. **New Credit (10%)**
   - **Significance**: Opening multiple new credit accounts in a short period can be risky for lenders.
   - **Impact**: Each new application for credit can slightly lower your score temporarily.

5. **Credit Mix (10%)**
   - **Significance**: A diverse mix of credit accounts (e.g., credit cards, mortgage, auto loans) can positively impact your score.
   - **Impact**: It shows that you can manage different types of credit.

### Credit Score Ranges
